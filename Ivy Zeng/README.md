## Abstract
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act is a federal law that was signed into law in 1996. The purpose of this is to ensure the safety and privacy of sensitive health information from being disclosed without the knowledge of the patient. This is also made true in correctional facilities. Inmates have the same HIPAA rights as civilians, like the minimum necessary standard. Covered entities under HIPAA include any health plan, healthcare clearinghouse, or healthcare provider who communicates Protected Health Information (PHI) electronically. This paper will review the privacy regulations in correctional facilities and the stigma surrounding HIV. I describe how the minimum necessary utilizes protected health information for intended purposes and under what circumstances can law enforcement receive protected health information. In addition, I will focus on the stigma surrounding HIV-positive inmates and how the segregation of HIV-positive inmates is a breach of confidentiality. Methods used are MeSH search on the National Library of Medicine to identify papers that present data on privacy regulations in prison. We will also use a public dataset on staff stigma attitudes surrounding HIV in correctional facilities. 

## Introduction
  * Healthcare providers in correctional facilities fall under “covered entities” under HIPAA. 
  * Covered entities are allowed to disclose the PHI of inmates without their authorization to correctional institutions or law enforcement officials who have lawful custody of an inmate for the purpose of providing health care. [Health Information Privacy and Health Information Technology in the US Correctional Setting](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3987588/#:~:text=Covered%20entities%20may%20disclose%20the,the%20officers%20and%20employees%20of)
  * HIPAA integrates the principle of minimum necessity by instructing covered entities to only disclose information to courts that are specifically authorized by judicial order. 
  * The purpose of these laws is to encourage greater participation and trust in the healthcare system through the protection of a patient’s private health information. 
  * HIV segregation increases stigma and discrimination against inmates.
  * In 2021, about 1.1% of persons incarcerated in state and federal prisons were known to be persons with HIV. This is 3x higher than the public. [Quick Stats on HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STIs, and TB Among Justice-Involved Persons](https://www.cdc.gov/correctionalhealth/health-data.html)
  * A staff survey that was completed among 218 correctional staff in 32 US facilities provides an overview of staff’s stigma attitudes.
  * Correctional and medical staff expressed non-stigmatizing attitudes toward people living with HIV/AIDS but seems that stigma and discrimination still exist in others. [HIV Stigma in Prisons and Jails: Results from a Staff Survey](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26036464/)
  * Discrimination against prisoners with HIV violates human rights law and breaks US guidelines for the management of HIV in prisons. 
  * Alabama and South Carolina continue to insist that segregation is justified by the need to provide medical care and the goal of preventing HIV transmission in prison. 

## Method

  * I will use the academic database PubMed to identify papers that present information on privacy regulations in correctional facilities. 
  * I will use the MeSH search on the National Library of Medicine with subject headings that include “HIPAA”, “Prison”, Correctional Facilities”, “Privacy”, “Protected Health Information”, “Health Information Exchange”
  * Going through the results of the MeSH search, I will identify articles that were written about correctional facilities in the United States. 
  * We are going to exclude articles that were published before 1996, given that HIPAA was not passed at the time.
  * I will calculate the percentage of staff surveys and their attitudes towards HIV.
