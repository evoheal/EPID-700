## Abstract

The high mortality rate among individuals recently released from incarceration is a pressing concern. This population faces an elevated risk of death, especially within the first two weeks post-release, emphasizing the need for an effective reentry support. The project's objective is to address the health-related challenges encountered by this population and support their successful reintegration into society. By recognizing the potential of mobile health technology in greatly improving the delivery of care during the critical reentry phase a health website will be developed to empower recently released individuals with the knowledge and resources necessary to make informed health decisions, ultimately facilitating their successful reintegration into society. Employing a multifaceted approach, the research involves a systematic review of existing literature, aiming to gain insights into their distinct health concerns and fill knowledge gaps to guide the development of a tailored website. Additionally, the research includes a content analysis of existing health-focused websites tailored to recently released individuals, providing reference points for creating an intuitive and efficient platform. Furthermore, a demographic profile will be developed, with particular attention to age and gender, to offer insights into their specific health information requirements, ensuring that the website content remains pertinent and accessible. These key findings from the systematic review, website evaluation, and demographic profile will be synthesized and integrated to shape the content and features of the website. A conceptual framework for the website will also be presented and mockup webpages will be generated using the graphic tool Canva.
## Introduction
•	Recently released individuals face a disproportionately high risk of mortality. <br/>

•	Within the first two weeks after release, the risk of death is 12.7 times higher compared to the general population . [Release from prison--a high risk of death for former inmates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2836121/). <br/>

•	Prison and jail inmates generally have greater access to healthcare services compared to when they are in the community. [The Unmet Medical Needs of Correctional Populations in the United States](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0027968415302145). <br/>

•	Providing effective reentry assistance and ensuring well-informed health choices are crucial steps towards minimizing health disparities among this population. <br/>

• The shift from incarceration to reintegrating into the community presents several obstacles, such as restricted availability of essential healthcare resources and information. [Understanding and Addressing Health Disparities and Health Needs of Justice-Involved Populations](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0033354918813089). <br/>

• Timely access to healthcare, health information, and ongoing health management is crucial, considering that the risk of mortality is highest in the early days and weeks after release. <br/>

•	People who have recently been released from incarceration often struggle with navigating the complex healthcare system, which can result in insufficient use of healthcare services and worsen existing health issues. [Incarceration and the health of the african american community](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231786270_Incarceration_and_the_Health_of_the_African_American_Community). <br/>

•	The restricted availability of clear and understandable health information increases the risk of negative health outcomes for recently released individuals. [Coming Home from Jail: The Social and Health Consequences of Community Reentry for Women, Male Adolescents, and Their Families and Communities](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2004.056325). <br/>

•	To enhance the successful reintegration and enhance health, it is crucial to meet the health information requirements of recently released individuals. [Criminal (In)Justice in the City and Its Associated Health Consequences](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.98.Supplement_1.S185). <br/>

•	Recent statistics highlight that New York City stands out with one of the highest rates of post-release individuals in the United States. [Since you asked: How many people are released from each state’s prisons and jails every year?](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2022/08/25/releasesbystate/) <br/>

•	The high number of individuals released in New York City makes it a relevant location for this research, providing a substantial context for the study. <br/>

•	The development of a user-centric, informative, and accessible health program is a crucial step towards improving the overall health and prospects of individuals recently released from incarceration. [Building effective service delivery mechanisms for justice-involved individuals: an under-researched area](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2194-7899-2-2). <br/>

•	I will develop a conceptual plan for a website with the goal of equipping individuals with the information and resources necessary to make well-informed health choices and facilitate their successful reintegration into society.
## Methods

•	My first approach in this research is a systematic review.<br/>

•	Conduct a rigorous systematic review of existing literature concerning the health and reintegration challenges faced by recently released individuals.<br/>

•	I will get a complete summary of what we know about recently released individuals. [Scoping studies: advancing the methodology](https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1748-5908-5-69).<br/>

•	I will follow the 5 stages of the scoping review by Arksey and O’Malley. [Scoping studies: towards a methodological framework](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1364557032000119616?needAccess=true). <br/>

•	I will explore the available information regarding the health requirements of recently released individuals.<br/>

•	I will investigate the primary factors contributing to poor health and mortality rates among recently released individuals.<br/>

•	I will examine whether there are any areas of insufficient research on health information for recently released individuals.<br/>

•	I will involve comprehensive searches in reputable academic databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar.<br/>

•	I will apply predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to select studies that meet the research objectives.<br/>

•	I will include in the search all geographical locations and only research from peer-reviewed journal articles that are relevant to released individuals.<br/>

•	I will Extract relevant data from selected studies, including key findings and gaps in research.<br/> 

•	I will perform a qualitative synthesis of the reviewed literature and provide a summary table.<br/>

•	My second approach is to evaluate the content and user interface of existing websites that provide health information to recently released individuals.<br/>

•	I will Identify and select a range of existing websites that offer health information to recently released individuals, including government resources, nonprofit organizations' sites, or other platforms targeting this population.<br/>

•	This content analysis will focus on factors such as accessibility, comprehensibility, and relevance of the information provided.<br/>

•	My third approach is to establish a comprehensive profile.<br/> 

•	I will categorize the demographic information, such as age and gender, of recently released individuals, utilizing the dataset from the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision which encompasses details of individuals released into the community between 2008 and 2018. [Recidivism: Beginning 2008](https://data.ny.gov/Public-Safety/Recidivism-Beginning-2008/y7pw-wrny). <br/>

•	I will create visual representations, such as demographic distribution charts and graphs, to provide clear and interpretable insights into the age and gender demographics of recently released individuals.<br/>

•	I will integrate findings from demographic profiles, content analysis, and literature review to analyze how age and gender influence the specific health information needs of recently released individuals. <br/>

•	Using this analysis I will offer important insights for customizing the content and features of the website. <br/>

•	Finally, I will develop a conceptual plan for a user-centric, informative, and accessible health-focused website, outlining the structure, content, and features of the platform. <br/>

•	I'll use Canva, to design prototype webpages. This will provide a clear visual representation and refinement of the website. Resulting in a prototype.<br/>
