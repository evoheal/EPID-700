# Assessing the Impact of Dissemination of Public Resources on the Risks of Sugar-Sweetened Beverages (SSBs) Among Adults in New York City

## Abstract
Several campaigns targeting sugary predators have been launched in New York City (NYC) in the recent decade to address the dangers of consuming sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). With a significant amount of evidence correlating the link between SSB consumption and co-morbidities such as obesity, type-2 diabetes, and heart disease, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has launched several educational campaigns to advise on the dangers of SSB consumption and disseminate it across the five boroughs. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of publicly available public health materials on trends in SSB consumption among adults. Using data from the 2010–2020 NYC Community Health Survey (CHS), we are able to assess the effects of anti-SSB marketing conducted by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene on consumer behaviors and consumption. Comparing the dissemination of resources provided by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene would highlight potential gaps in resource availability and community engagement with educational programming. 

## Introduction
- Disease risk of excess SBB consumption among [adults.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2862465/#:~:text=SSB%20intake%20is%20a%20significant,of%20T2DM%20and%20cardiovascular%20disease.)
- Influences of SBB consumption and [individual behaviors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24070799/)
- Racial and ethnic disparities are prevalent in obesity among [NYC adults.](https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/brfss/reports/docs/2023-04_obesity_disparities.pdf)
- Racial and ethnic disparities are prevalent in SSB consumption among [NYC adults.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2329746/?version=meter+at+null&module=meter-Links&pgtype=Blogs&contentId=&mediaId=&referrer=&priority=true&action=click&contentCollection=meter-links-click)
- Geographic disparities in SSB consumption are prevalent in NYC [neighborhoods.](https://www.nycfoodpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FS10567_2017.pdf)
- There is a higher incidence of predatory marketing of SSB in lower-income NYC [neighborhoods.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31917059/)
- There is a higher availability of SSB in lower-income NYC [neighborhoods.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35557551/)
- There is interest in the re-investment of SSB tax revenue into NYC [communities.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10995-021-03255-8)
- The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has identified a [plateau](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35557551/) after the decline of SSB consumption across NYC neighborhoods.
- The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has implemented a community [framework](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/che/community-engagement-framework.pdf) to engage communities in response to public health issues that are prevalent.
- Limitations are shown in studies that target the health messaging of [socioeconomically disadvantaged adults.](https://journals.lww.com/jbisrir/fulltext/2020/07000/effects_of_health_literacy_interventions_on.3.aspx)
- The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has used a [mixed-media strategy](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2019/campaign-comparing-sugary-drinks-cigarettes.page) to disseminate advise against the consumption of SSB.
- From 2017 to 2019 there has been an increase in community partnerships with the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to disseminate [educational materials.](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/cdp/sugary-drink-handout-eng-sp.pdf)
- Studies have shown that there is a correlation between [higher community social capital](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37624595/) and population health outcomes.

## Methods
- I will begin by analyzing current, ongoing print and media campaigns by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene against SSB.
- I will analyze previous print and media campaigns from 2010-2020 by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene against SSB.
- I will canvass available print campaigns targeted against the consumption of SSB located in [NYC Neighborhood Action Centers.](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/neighborhood-health/neighborhood-health-action-centers.page)
- Identify gaps in resource availability of  educational material of SSB
- Using publicly available data from the [NYC Community Health Survey],(https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/community-health-survey-public-use-data.page) I will compute the average daily SSB consumption among adults from 2010-2020 of ages 18-65.
- Using publicly available data from the [NYC Community Health Survey](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/community-health-survey-public-use-data.page), I will compute the average daily SSB consumption among adults from 2010-2020 by community districts identified by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
- Using the data collected from the [NYC Community Health Survey](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/community-health-survey-public-use-data.page), I will compute the correlation between the printed availability of media campaigns and the consumption of SSBs between 2010-2020.
- Assess the implementation of the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene community framework with the distribution of educational materials.
- Assess the timeframe between the updated media campaigns of SSB between 2010-2020.
- Assess patterns related to SSB consumption and NYC SSB distribution of educational materials.
